Please note that ChessGuess is currently in the very early stages of development and is not yet functional. It is merely an idea at this point, and the features described are aspirational goals for the future. I am actively working on bringing this concept!

# ChessGuess

ChessGuess is a web application designed to challenge users to guess the Elo rating of a random chess game. The application uses a React and TypeScript stack with Vite.

### Dependencies
